- 1'st && 3'rd person camera
- procedural terrain generation form [my other project](https://github.com/LeaveMyAlpaca/proceduralMapGen) 
- works with any 3d model
- High G-force effects simulation
- 2 plane examples - f16 && propeller plane
- Volumetric clouds compute shader 
### plans
- More accurate engine simulation 
- Destruction system 
- Fuel usage && weight simulation 
## Setup
### Just trying out
- download and run exe form releas page
### Edit project
- download <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4-stable/">godot 4.4</a>  in .Net version
- setup your godot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi1iIM-B7XQ">like in this video </a>
- clone this github repo
- open cloned directory with godot 4.4
